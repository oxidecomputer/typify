https://github.com/oxidecomputer/typify/compare/v0.0.11\...v0.0.12[Full list of commits]

== 0.0.11 (released 2023-03-18)

This is a big update with many, many changes to code generation, and many more
JSON schema structures well-handled. Among the many changes:

* Generate a `ToString` impl for untagged enums with trivial variants (#145)
* Allow conversion overrides by specifying a schema (#155)
* Handle untyped enums that contain nulls (#167)
* Handle `not` schemas for enumerated values (#168)
* Improve generated code for FromStr and TryFrom impls (#174)
* Handle format specifiers for enumerated strings (#188)

=== *Breaking*: The removal of `TypeSpace::to_string()`

Previously all transitive consumers required the presence of `rustfmt`. In this
version we leave formatting to the consumer. See link:README.md#formatting[the formatting section of the README] for details on formatting.

=== CLI

This version adds the `cargo-typify` crate for stand-alone code generation.

=== Augmented Generation

Consumers can now affect how code is generated in several ways:
* adding derive macros to all generated types
* modifying specific types by name to rename them or add derive macros
* specifying a replacement type by name
* specifying a replacement type by schema pattern


https://github.com/oxidecomputer/typify/compare/v0.0.10\...v0.0.11[Full list of commits]

* Allow per-type renames and derive macro applications (#131)
* `ToString` implementations for untagged enums with trivial newtype variants (#145)
* Fixed an issue with generation of enum defaults (#137)
* Allow conversion overrides by specifying a schema (#155)
